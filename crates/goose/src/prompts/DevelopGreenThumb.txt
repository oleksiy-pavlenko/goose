Develop a GreenThumb app.  

GreenThumb is a simple mobile application designed to help users discover various plants. The app consists of two screens:  

### **Discover Screen:**  
- Displays a list of plants with a small image and name, loaded from a public server:  
  `https://trefle.io/api/v1/plants?token=VIFXq0ztN_WFUpOKWbi-XDvy1bmC2dqxVHx7u2wImvw`  
- When a user clicks on a list item, they are taken to the **Plant Detail Screen**.  

### **Plant Detail Screen:**  
- Shows detailed information about the selected plant, including:  
  - A larger image  
  - The common name  
  - The scientific name  
- The data is fetched using this URL:  
  `https://trefle.io/api/v1/plants/{plant_id}?token=VIFXq0ztN_WFUpOKWbi-XDvy1bmC2dqxVHx7u2wImvw`  
- Includes a **back button** to return to the **Discover Screen**.

Do not tell me what to do - just do it using the extensions.
